# Section 7: Testing

**Time:** 10 minutes

## Objectives

- Write tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Use GitHub Copilot to generate test cases.

## Activities and GitHub Copilot Prompts

### 7.1. Write a Simple Test

1. Create a Test File

   - Create `App.test.tsx`.

2. Type Test Description

   - Invoke the **Inline Chat** (`Ctrl+I` or `Cmd+I`) and perform a query with the **tests** command, like the following:

     ```md
     /tests Test if the App component renders correctly
     ```

   - Try asking for additional tests to check that the forecast shows when you input a city

### 7.2. Writing Testable Code

1. Refactor for Easier Testing

   - Open the **Chat View** (`Ctrl+Alt+I` or `Cmd+Alt+I`) and perform a **workspace** query like the following:

     ```md
     How can I make the App component more testable?
     ```

   - Copilot will offer several suggestions that will make testing easier
   - Try implementing some of the sugggestions and then repeat the process outlined above in 7.1.
