# Section 9: Documentation and README Generation

## **Time:** 5 minutes


## Objectives:

*   Create a basic `README.md`.


## Activities and GitHub Copilot Prompts:

### 9.1. Create `README.md`

1.  At the root of your project, create a file named README.md.

2. In the README file use the **Inline Chat** and prompt Copilot to do the following:
    ```
    Create a comprehensive Readme with the project title, description, list of features, prerequisites, instalation steps and explination of usage
    ```
3. This will set you up with a good basis for a README. Update the content to be more concise with the project.
