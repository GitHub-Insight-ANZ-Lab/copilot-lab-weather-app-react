# GitHub Copilot Workshop for Front-end developers

## Introduction
This workshop is designed for front-end developers familiar with React and TypeScript. Participants will build a weather application that integrates the OpenWeatherMap API, utilising GitHub Copilot to enhance productivity and code quality. The workshop covers key topics such as state management, testing, debugging, performance optimization, responsive design, accessibility, API security, deployment, and Git workflows.


## Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand how to set up a development environment optimised for GitHub Copilot.
- Gain proficiency in using GitHub Copilot's features to accelerate coding tasks.
- Build a weather app with functionalities using React and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge in React, Typescript, Javascript, CSS
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code installed
- GitHub Copilot extension installed in Visual Studio Code

## Lab Tasks
For each of the tasks in this section use either inline completions (ghost text), Copilot Chat or the Copilot in-line popup (CTRL + I on Windows or Command + I on macOS) to generate the code.
