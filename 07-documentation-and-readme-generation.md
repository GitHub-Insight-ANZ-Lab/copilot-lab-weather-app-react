# Section 7: Documentation and README Generation

## **Time:** 5 minutes

## Objectives

- Create a basic `README.md`.

## Activities and GitHub Copilot Prompts

### 7.1. Create `README.md`

1. At the root of your project, create a file named README.md.

2. In the README file use the **Inline Chat** and prompt Copilot to do the following:

   ```md
   Create a comprehensive Readme with the project title, description, list of features, prerequisites, instalation steps and explination of usage
   ```

3. This will set you up with a good basis for a README. Update the content to be more concise with the project.
